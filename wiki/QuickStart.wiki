Here is a quick recipe for getting started:

   * *Download the source code* either by download (stable) or svn (latest and greatest)

   * *Get your VirusTotal API Key* at http://www.virustotal.com

         _Sign up to VT Community (using the sign in box at the top left hand side of
         the page). Once you have a valid VT Community account, you will find your
         personal API key in the inbox of your account (sign in and drop down the My
         account menu). This key is all you need to use VirusTotal's API._

   * *Update lgvtotal.py* with your key. (Find "API_KEY")

   * *Run* the script

       _python lgvtotal.py my_file_to_be_scanned_
